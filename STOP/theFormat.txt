STOP/3 Protocol Documentation

Client sends zero-terminated strings.

Firstly, the server sends a zero-terminated string identifier.
Here, it is "STOP/3".

The client then sends a client identifier.
It is also "STOP/3".

Until a future specification clarifies these identifiers, please send "STOP/3".

The protocol is then client-driven.

From here on in, types will be referred to either as "string" (zero-terminated UTF-8 string),
 or their DataOutputStream type (UnsignedByte, UnsignedShort, Int, Long)

The commands are:

-- Video Group, Versions "STOP/3", "STOP/3+DSS" --

"PACK": The server sends back the video data as fast as possible.
The following set of structures describes the video data.

Frame:
 Int tapeTime
 String subtitle // If used, this takes up the final line, which must be clipped out of subpackets
 UnsignedShort packetCount
 Packet[packetCount] packets
 UnsignedByte terminate // Non-zero means terminate

Packet:
 UnsignedByte paletteColour // 0-15: Greyscale default customs, 16-255: OC Tier3 Palette
 UnsignedShort subpacketCount
 Subpacket[subpacketCount] subpackets

Subpacket:
 UnsignedByte x // Zero-based coordinates
 UnsignedByte y
 UnsignedByte w // 1, 1 is 1 char by 1 char
 UnsignedByte h
 UnsignedByte set // Non-zero means use a .set rather than a .fill

Thus, an empty stream, with only the subtitle "Time to go away..." is the following Lua String:
"\x00\x00\x00\x00Time to go away...\x00\x00\x00\x01"

-- Audio Group, Versions "STOP/3" --

"AUDIO": The server sends back an Int, indicating the amount of audio bytes.
"SEND": The server sends back the audio data, which must be no more or less than the amount of data specified by the AUDIO response.

-- Audio Group, Versions "STOP/3+DSS" (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) --

"AUDIOLAYOUT": The server sends back an Int describing the amount of channels, followed by an UnsignedByte per channel for that channel's meaning.

Valid meanings are:
0: Mono (all channels mixed. This channel SHOULD exist as a fallback for clients without DSS support)
1: Stereo Left
2: Stereo Right
3: DSS4OC Left Front (Green)
4: DSS4OC Left Back (Red)
5: DSS4OC Center Front (White)
6: DSS4OC Right Back (Orange/Amber)
7: DSS4OC Right Front (Cyan)

"SEND" is now "SEND-0" through "SEND-n", where 'n' is the channel ID.
All of these have the same length, as reported by AUDIO.
